# move_terraform_state
Example code on how a terraform state could be moved from local to remote backend.


# TO-DO

- Create 1 folder for sample code, run terraform apply
- Create a folder for random_pet
- move the state
- add a remote state backend to state push to TFE
- Update code to reference the remote state
- reference the state on random_pet
- Note: not sure this will work, lets try
- Terraform apply should say the nothing to be created, state should persists.
- Terraform destroy should work and delete the existing state


# DONE
